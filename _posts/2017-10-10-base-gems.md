# Code quality / Review / Refactoring
## Rubocop
RuboCop is a Ruby static code analyzer. Out of the box it will enforce many of the guidelines outlined in the community [Ruby Style Guide][https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide].

## rack-mini-profiler
This is a nice tool used for finding bottlenecks of your applications. It does a live speed analysis of how long it took for the request to be processed and how much of that time it was doing various renderings, database queries and DOM loading. Just plug it into your Gemfile and you'll get a small window in the upper left corner of your page, showing you all of these information.

## rubycritic
It wraps around three static analysis gems - [Reek][https://github.com/troessner/reek] (ruby code smells), [Flay][https://github.com/seattlerb/flay] (code duplication detection) and [Flog][https://github.com/seattlerb/flog] (ABC metrics). It creates nicely structured HTML files so you can browse through your code smells and start refactoring.

# Code cleaning
## traceroute
Traceroute is a route cleaning tool for Rails applications. It provides a simple rake task for checking which routes are mapped to non existing controller actions, and finds out which controller actions are not reachable.

## Better_errors
It provides cleanly formatted errors with log details in the browser just a click-away.  
As per the README, make sure to check out the complementary gem “binding_of_caller“, which gives you functionality similar to Pry-Debugger (described above) – but this functionality is inside your web browser when a better_errors’ error is thrown.

# Test
## RSpec
## RSpec-rails
## Factory_bot_rails (former factory_girl)
## Shoulda-matchers
## Capybara
## Database_cleaner
## Simplecov
## faker
## launchy
Sometimes when your test specs are failing, the error messages just aren’t informative enough – you need to see what the test is seeing in the browser. This can be especially maddening when everything appears to be fine in the browser in the development environment, but your tests are failing. Here comes Launchy to the rescue!
In Capybara 2.0.0.beta2, screenshotting has become part of the API and can be done like this:
```ruby
page.save_screenshot 'screenshot.png'
Launchy.open 'screenshot.png' # or open manually
```

#Security

## brakeman
A security analysis tool for your Rails applications. It scans through your application and outputs a nicely formatted table of possible vulnerabilities. Security warnings are grouped according to their severity (High, Medium and Low). You can learn more about their meanings on brakeman's list of [warnings][https://brakemanscanner.org/docs/warning_types/].
