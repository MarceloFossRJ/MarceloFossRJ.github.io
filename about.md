My name is Marcelo Foss, you can find me in the web and social networks also with the usernames marcelo.foss.rj or marcelofossrj; 
I graduated from college as chemical engineer, but evolved a career in IT, mainly developing software. I would say that I am a software creator and chemical engineer that likes to take pictures.

I created the DevRecipes.blog to archive programming recipes, reference cards and cheat sheets that I use. Later I realized that would be a nice place to also my thoughts and convictions about the art of creating software.

I've been working in software development for a while, and touched many things in it.
From software developer to IT Manager, from solution architect to hiring a distributed team, from leading international teams to designing data migrations.

My biggest interest is on the production of useful and efficient software systems, as well as, improving how it is delivered, and to maximize the productivity of software development teams.

I enjoy to architect, design and write enterprise class software, and the processes that support its development.
I do value lightweight agile processes, BDD, and good design. But above all: shipping

Lately I am focusing mostly in Ruby & RoR, and Javascript & AngularJS.
