# Install Snapd
My servers are running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, which have snapd installed by default.
If for any reason it is not installed:
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install snapd
```
Ensure that your version of snapd is up to date:
```
$ sudo snap install core
$ sudo snap refresh core
```
# Remove any Certbot OS packages
If you have any Certbot packages installed using an OS package manager like apt, dnf, or yum, you should remove them before installing the Certbot snap to ensure that when you run the command certbot the snap is used rather than the installation from your OS package manager
```
$ sudo apt-get remove certbot
```

# Install Certbot
```
$ sudo snap install --classic certbot
```
# Prepare the Certbot command
```
$ sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```

# Confirm plugin containment level
Run this command on the command line on the machine to acknowledge that the installed plugin will have the same classic containment as the Certbot snap.
```
$ sudo snap set certbot trust-plugin-with-root=ok
```
If you encounter issues with running Certbot, you may need to follow this step, then the "Install correct DNS plugin" step, again.

# Install correct DNS plugin according to your DNS provider
in my case is Linode, please check the list of available plugins [https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#dns-plugins](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#dns-plugins)
```
$ sudo snap install certbot-dns-linode
```
# Set up credentials
Retrieve your Linode API credentials at your Linode account.
Create a credentials file like this (.linode_credentials.ini)
```
# Linode API credentials used by Certbot
dns_linode_key = 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ64
```
To acquire a single certificate for both example.com and *.example.com
```
certbot certonly \
  --dns-linode \
  --dns-linode-credentials ~/.secrets/certbot/linode.ini \
  -d example.com \
  -d *.example.com
```
